about this site...
==================

i've built several personal websites over the years, each time learning some new lessons.
Here's the process which led to the site you see before you now.

The code is on github [here](http://github.com/echohead/echohead.org)

# requirements
* deploy with `git push`
* no editing of html/css directly
* syntax highlighting
* conveniences for development mode
* hackability
* tests

# deploying with `git push`
As a developer, git is already constantly at my fingertips, so why not use it for deployment?
This approach has several advantages:
* any change that goes to production is by definition in source control.
* rollbacks are simple.
* every change gets checked in anyway, so why have additional steps?
